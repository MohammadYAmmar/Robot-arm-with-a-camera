In detail for some of what I used it was only in this task in two languages HTML and CSS

When using the Arabic language, you must not forget this line at the beginning

عند استخدام اللغة العربية يجب عدم نسيان هذا السطر في البداية
`<html dir="rtl" lang="ar">`

I first used fonts from Google and this is how it works
`@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cairo:wght@900&display=swap');`
