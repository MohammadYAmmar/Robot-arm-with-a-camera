# Steps to create a database:

1 - Create a database with 10 rows which is the number of buttons (date and time increased later) . This was created via a program XAMPP From the databases and control panel availability feature phpMyAdmin

2- Then add names, type, and size to each element, like motors, by designing them in the web via HTML, the section space that will be stored from 1 to 100 was added to this size

3  - The need to use the date arose, so it was added at the beginning with ease and it was also easy to modify one line in a function that was done to achieve the principle of DRY to modify the writing line of the database
